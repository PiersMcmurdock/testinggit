<strong>Website development 2010 - Now </strong> <br/><br/>
During my placement year I created a website for a company called Breastwise and I managed the website of a company called Laser-Clear. 

Since working at Tesco I have used my existing programming knowledge not only in the creation and management of Joomla content pages but also to enhance the look of Totara pages to provide a higher standard of content on Academy Online. I have used my knowledge of the latest technologies including HTML5 and Javascript to provide added usability both on desktops and mobile devices. I have also created an application for administrators to help with their email marketing campaigns.  I have installed configured and used Drupal for university projects and have used Joomla to manage Academy Online website content.
